This plugin sends a message to all the channels the bot is a member
of when it first joins the channel if the bot's version changed.

- Message: The message to send.  Must be at least 1 character and not all whitespace.  {%version%} is replaced with the Chaskis version.
- Channels:  The channels to send the message to.  If no channels are specified,
             then the message will be sent out to ALL channels the bot has joined.
